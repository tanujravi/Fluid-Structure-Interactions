# Fluid-Structure-Interactions
C++ code that implements immersed boundary method to simulate Fluid structure interactions. In this code, deformations experienced by a circular elastic capsule due to a fluid flowing in a 2-D channel is simulated. Fluid is in an eulurian frame and elastic capsule is taken in a lagrangian frame.
